# CloudStorageBucket
This project simulates a Cloud Storage Bucket setup — similar to AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, or Azure Blob — to understand how cloud storage organizes and manages files.
It demonstrates how folders, files, and access settings can be structured in a scalable and efficient way.

Cloud storage buckets are widely used by companies to store, manage, and share digital assets like images, documents, and videos.
They offer scalability, backup, and accessibility across devices.
For example, a design agency might use cloud storage to save and share client projects securely among team members.

#Tools / Environment:
    - Simulated locally using file system folders
    - Tools: File Explorer / Notepad (for documentation)
    - No actual cloud credentials required
